# Preamble

At the heart of this book are these assumptions:

- Data-driven: we are at our core, rationale beings, and base our decisions on quantifiable evidence 
- Exploration: we  haven't lost our innate curiosity about the world and are not only willing but eager to learn

Please stop reading, if those two assumptions are not fulfilled and pick up a different book.
